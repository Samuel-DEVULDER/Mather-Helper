# Mathler-Helper
Tool to help solving mathler-like games.

It all started on a discussion in [fr.sci.math](http://news2web.pasdenom.info/article.php?id=28764&group=fr.sci.maths) (on usenet).

This tool was ported from [PROLOG](https://pastebin.com/YV7xRsdg) to C thank to the wonderful [CBack](http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/CBACK/) library by K. Helsgaun published in Softw. pract. exp., Vol. 25, No. 8, 1995 (pp. 905-934).
